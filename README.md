# Alpha Return

Compare your investments against market indices such as the S&P500 or even cryptos like Bitcoin to see if you are getting [Alpha](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alpha.asp) returns. The returns from the benchmark and investments are in the form of [Annual Return](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/annual-return.asp) which is computed from the price on the buy and sell dates of said investments.

# Cross Platform App Development

Here is the current proof of concept for mobile and web being done with Flutter and Dart in Android Studio.
