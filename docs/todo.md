# To do:
- Add Benchmark set to specify (Dow Jones, BTC, NASDAQ, International?)
- Accounting for dividends (reinvested dividends that is)
- Account for deflation ( can utilize GDP deflator). Potential option for this is dividing Annual Returns for each investment by average rate of inflation over duration of investment. Would be best to find the most common way to accomplish deflation for investments...
